# Claude HUD Interface Instructions

## Overview

You have a set of MCP tools at your disposal, clickhouse_mcp to list tables and generate queries / test queries, and grafana_mcp to actually create a dashboard that's publicly accessible.

## Before creating a dashboard

- use Clickhouse mcp tools to research the schema of the data source
- always test the query using Clickhouse mcp

## notes

- current folder is a temporary directory, nothing interesting here
- for best results, use concise, clear queries
